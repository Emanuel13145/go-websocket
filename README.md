## üìã Overview

go-websocket is a WebSocket service framework that supports distributed deployment, built with the Go programming language. It efficiently stores client connection information using Redis and utilizes gRPC for message passing between service nodes. This design allows for real-time communication across different nodes.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Before you begin, ensure your system meets the following requirements:

- Operating Systems: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- Internet Connection: Required for initial setup and downloading
- Redis: Installed and running (for storing connections)
- gRPC: Properly configured (for message passing)

Make sure your system has enough resources to run the application smoothly.
